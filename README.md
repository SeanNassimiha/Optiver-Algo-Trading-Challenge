# Optiver-Challenge-Market-Making-Algo
Submission for the Optiver Challenge as part of the Hex Cambridge Hackathon in January 2021

This is the repo for the algorithm created as part of the Optiver challenge.

The algorithm we created is MAD-LAD: Market Arbitrage Dual-Listing Algorithmic Delta (Neutral), which is a delta-neutral market-making algorithm that trades on the illiquid market and hedges on the more liquid market.
